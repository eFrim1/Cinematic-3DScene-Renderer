# Cinematic 3D Scene Renderer with OpenGL

## Overview
This project is a 3D graphics application that renders a cinematic scene using OpenGL. 
It features keyframe-based camera movement, lighting, and object rendering for an immersive visual experience. 
The system supports smooth transitions between keyframes, real-time rendering optimizations, and user-controlled interactions

## Features
- **Keyframe-based camera movement** with smooth interpolation.
- **Real-time rendering** with OpenGL.
- **Dynamic lighting effects** using shaders.
- **Custom scene with objects** for visualization.
- **User interaction support**

 Built with **C++, OpenGL, and GLM**
